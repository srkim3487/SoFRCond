Author: Sooran Kim
Maintainer: Sooran Kim <Sooran.Kim@nyulangone.org>
Description: The package provides functions for parameter estimation of two models (i) a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model with functional covariates, and (ii) a binary conditional model with functional covariates. The functions also compute p-values for hypothesis tests of the null hypothesis spatial dependence parameter= 0 and/or beta = 0.
